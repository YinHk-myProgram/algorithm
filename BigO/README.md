## BigO
There are two factors affect program performance: 
- Time complexity
- Space complexity

In programming space and time complexity matters a lot when we need to execute a program. Our algorithm should be efficient, and it should take less time. Whenever you’re writing a solution to a program, some memory is required to complete, and it is important for our program to take less memory and execute within a given timeframe. 

> A good program should take less memory and take less time to be executed


### Comparision of time complexity
**O(1) < O(log n) < O(n) < O(n log n) < O(n²) < O(n³) < O(2^n) < O(3^n) < O(n!)**

### No extra space or O(1) extra space
> Constant space means that the amount of space that your algorithm uses is independent of the input parameters. 
Say you are given an array of size n. If the amount of space your algorithm uses scales with n, then it's not constant.
