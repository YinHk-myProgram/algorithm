## BigO
- Time complexity
- Space complexity

### Comparision of time complexity
**O(1) < O(log n) < O(n) < O(n log n) < O(n²) < O(n³) < O(2^n) < O(3^n) < O(n!)**

### No extra space or O(1) extra space
> Constant space means that the amount of space that your algorithm uses is independent of the input parameters. 
Say you are given an array of size n. If the amount of space your algorithm uses scales with n, then it's not constant.
