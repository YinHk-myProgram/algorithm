## Recurrsion

### What is Recursion? 
The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called as recursive function. Using recursive algorithm, certain problems can be solved quite easily.

The problem is broken down and if the problem is solved already then saved value is returned, otherwise, the value of the function is **memoized** i.e. it will be calculated for the first time; for every other time, the stored value will be called back. **Memoization** is a great way for computationally expensive programs.


A famous problem use recurrsion method to solve - **Fibonacci numbers**
