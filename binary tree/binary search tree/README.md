## Binary Search Tree(BST)

### Binary Tree vs Binary Search Tree
The key difference is that a BST only allows you to store nodes with lesser value on the left side and nodes with greater value on the right.

It has the following properties:
- The left subtree of a node has nodes which are only lesser than that node’s key.
- The right subtree of a node has nodes which are only greater than that node’s key.
- Each node has distinct keys and duplicates are not allowed in Binary Search Tree.
- The left and right subtree must also be a binary search tree.
