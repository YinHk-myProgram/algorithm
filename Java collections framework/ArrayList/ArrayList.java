/* 
Why ArrayList is better than Array?
Because The limitation with array is that it has a fixed length so if it is full you cannot add any more elements to it,
ArrayList can dynamically grow and shrink after addition and removal of elements, also we can use predefined methods of it which makes our task easy.

//declare an ArrayList
ArrayList<T> alist = new ArrayList<T>();       //define your data type

ArrayList<String> alist=new ArrayList<String>();    //string arraylist
ArrayList<Integer> list=new ArrayList<Integer>();   //integer arraylist

//Add elements
alist.add("element");

//Change an element
alist
