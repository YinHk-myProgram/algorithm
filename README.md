Cheatsheet and notes related to data structure & algorithm


In an algorithm design there is no one 'silver bullet' that is a cure for all computation problems. Different problems require the use of different kinds of techniques. A good programmer uses all these techniques based on the type of problem. Some commonly-used techniques are:

- Divide and conquer
- Randomized algorithms
- Brute Force
- Greedy Programming
- Dynamic Programming
