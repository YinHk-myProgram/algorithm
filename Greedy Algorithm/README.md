## Greedy Algorithm

A greedy algorithm is a simple, intuitive algorithm that is used in optimization problems. The algorithm makes the optimal choice at each step as it attempts to find the overall optimal way to solve the entire problem.


### What is Greedy Algorithm?
A greedy algorithm is an algorithm that attempt to find the solution in small steps, making a locally optimal at each step hoping to find a solution that can be applied globally.

Very often Greedy algorithm will give you the most optimal solution, by making the decision that looks the best at the moment.

In an algorithm design there is no one 'silver bullet' that is a cure for all computation problems. Different problems require the use of different kinds of techniques. A good programmer uses all these techniques based on the type of problem. Some commonly-used techniques are:

- Divide and conquer
- Randomized algorithms
- Greedy algorithms (This is not an algorithm, it is a technique.)
- Dynamic programming

Greedy algorithms have some advantages and disadvantages:

It is quite easy to come up with a greedy algorithm (or even multiple greedy algorithms) for a problem.
Analyzing the run time for greedy algorithms will generally be much easier than for other techniques (like Divide and conquer). For the Divide and conquer technique, it is not clear whether the technique is fast or slow. This is because at each level of recursion the size of gets smaller and the number of sub-problems increases.
The difficult part is that for greedy algorithms you have to work much harder to understand correctness issues. Even with the correct algorithm, it is hard to prove why it is correct. Proving that a greedy algorithm is correct is more of an art than a science. It involves a lot of creativity.
