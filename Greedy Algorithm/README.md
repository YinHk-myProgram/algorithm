## Greedy Algorithm

A greedy algorithm is a simple, intuitive algorithm that is used in optimization problems. The algorithm makes the optimal choice at each step as it attempts to find the overall optimal way to solve the entire problem.


### What is Greedy Algorithm?
A greedy algorithm is an algorithm that attempt to find the solution in small steps, making a locally optimal at each step hoping to find a solution that can be applied globally.

Very often Greedy algorithm will give you the most optimal solution, by making the decision that looks the best at the moment.
